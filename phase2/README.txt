General Card Game Rules:
1.  There are 2 types of cards, monster cards and spell cards, you can click on the available cards
    in your hands to either summon a monster card to your board or activate a spell card. Monster
    card has an attack value and a defence value, and a spell card has a special effect.
2.  Each player can only summon 1 monster card per turn and each monster card can only attack 1 time
    per turn, but spell cards can be activated without any precaution. However, monster cards can
    only be summoned to the board slot in front of them, and if it is occupied by another monster
    card, monster in hand cannot be summoned.
3.  Monster Card (Brown Border):
    Deep Red Card: Attack 100, Defence 2000
    Light Card: Attack 1800, Defence 0
4.  Spell Card (Green Border):
    Lightning Card: Destroys all card on enemy's board
5.  Turn Explanation:
    First turn: You can summon a monster, but the monster cannot attack, clicking next turn will
                cause the enemy to make its moves
    Second turn and onwards: You draw until your hand is full, you can summon another monster, and
                both summoned monsters can attack
6.  Battle Explanation:
    Clicking on a summoned card will trigger a dialog, where it asks the target of the attack. You
    can only attack the enemy directly if there are no monsters summoned on the enemy's field, and
    only attack enemy's summoned cards if they have any monsters summoned. Clicking any invalid
    attack target will not result in a successful attack and will not use up the once per turn
    attack of your attacking monster.

    Damage Calculation:
    When two monsters battles, if one monster's attack is higher than the attack of another monster,
    then the monster with the lower attack is destroyed, and the attack difference is dealt as
    damage to the player who summoned the weaker monster. If the attacks are equal, then mutual
    destruction occurs and no damage is dealt.
7.  Win and Lose Condition:
    A player will win if:
        The other player's health is reduced to 0 or the other palyer has no more cards to draw in
        their deck
